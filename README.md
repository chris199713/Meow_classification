# Meow_classification
This project attempts to use audio data to classify cat behavior.

This dataset, composed of 440 sound recordings, contains meows emitted by cats in different contexts. Specifically, 21 cats belonging to 2 breeds (Maine Coon and European Shorthair) have been repeatedly exposed to three different stimuli that act as labels for prediction:

Waiting for food;

Isolation in unfamiliar environment;

Brushing (being brushed affectionately by the owner).
